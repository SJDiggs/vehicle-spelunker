Ford, Toyota, etc), vehicle model (ie. Mustang, Prius) and vehicle year (current range 2015-2020), which when submitted will present the user with up to 2 matching vechcles and their relevant vehicle information including.

From there, the user can initiate a search to find vehicles for sale that match the make/model/year they are researching.  The result of ther search provides the user with a picture of the vehicle, the location of the vehicle, the price, color, mileage and other relevant information.
